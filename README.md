# Oliva
Library and Sample app for generating HTML baseball game data using [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish).

### Why would you do this?
I got mad when I drafted a fantasy baseball team and couldn't see them play because the pandemic shut down Major League Baseball. 
So I wrote a baseball simulator so I could see how the team I drafted would fare in a head-to-head game. 

This repo is how I convert the results to a static HTML site. I'm definitely pushing the limits of what [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) had in mind for his [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish) library, but that's how I roll.

### What does the output look like?

### What is Oliva?
[Tony Oliva](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/o/olivato01.shtml) was a Shortstop for the [Minnesota Twins](https://www.mlb.com/twins). He should be in the Hall of Fame. He's not, but Mr. Oliva might take some solace knowing there is an open source Swift library named after him. I sat next to him at a Twins game once. That was awesome.
