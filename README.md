Library and Sample app for generating HTML baseball game data using [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish).

### Why would you do this?
I got mad when I drafted a fantasy baseball team and couldn't see them play because the pandemic shut down Major League Baseball. 
So I wrote a baseball simulator so I could see how the team I drafted would fare in a head-to-head game. 

This repo is how I convert the results to an static HTML site. I'm definitely pushing the limits of what [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) had in mind for his [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish) library, but that's how I roll.

### What does the output look like?

[My League's HTML Output](https://fansim.netlify.app/cik-anon-ga/leagueresults/)
